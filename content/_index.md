Hey hey, I'm frosty. I'm interested in meteorology, programming, systems administration, and photography; I also like to experiment with minimalist software setups and unconventional workflows. I'm based in Tampa, Florida currently, but I plan on moving out of state at some point.

I work on a few projects occasionally, however they're mostly made for personal use only. One of those projects being this very website! This website serves as a playground for content and ideas that come to my head from time to time, and you'll likely see changes often.
